A Toki Pona Parser
This is a library for parsing toki pona, an artificial language where most lexical categories are closed. 
There are about 125 unbound morphemes (words). The syntax is also limited to a single sentence template, 
which formally can be represented in about a dozen rules. It small, toy-like size makes it suitable for 
linguistic experiments.

Using

At the moment, there isn't a UI other than the unit test runner.
