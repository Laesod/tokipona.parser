    <p>The normalizer processes arbitrary text and creates punctuated toki pona.</p>
    <p>
        The normalizer has a chicken & egg problem. It can't normalize accurately without knowing part of speech, where sentences end, etc.
        But that requires parsing. But to parse, we need either general purpose artificial intelligence, or predictable, relatively error free
        toki pona.

    <p>
        Normalize Chaos is for normalizing diglossia and would be able to assume that there is just a little toki pona. This one will incorrectly assume toki pona errors are foreign text.
        The regular normalizer assumes that the text is mostly toki pona. This one will incorrectly assume that foreign text is toki pona errors.
