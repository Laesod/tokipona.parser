"[Verse 4 And they said, Come! We'll build for us a city and a tower and its head [the tower's] in the sky, and we'll make for us a name, lest we be scattered on the face of all the earth.]"

"[Verse 7 Come! We will descend and we will confuse their language there, that [they] will not hear [one] man the language [of] his friend.]"

"o mi mute kama! mi mute li anpa, li nasa e toki ona. tenpo la jan li kute ala e toki pi jan pona."

tenpo la jan sewi Jawe li mute jan ni tawa selo pi ma ale. ona kama pali ala e ma tomo.

"[Verse 9 Therefore called its name Babel, because there YHWH confused the language of all the earth, and from there YHWH scattered them on the face of all the earth.]"
