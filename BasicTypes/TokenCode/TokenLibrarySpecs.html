    <p>I wish I had a library that was optimized for processing tokens (as opposed to String which are too low level).</p>
    <p>It should be similar to the string library, similar to string builder, similar to List of T</p>
    <p>Tasks</p>
    Tokenize<br/>
    Replace tozen with series of tokens (mistook a phrase for a token)<br />
    Replace sedries of tokens with one tokens (opposite mistake)<br />
    Support heterogenous tokens (i.e. tokensn that know how to ToString and Parse(string))<br />
    Token level pattern matching (find all the tokens followed by Z)<br />
