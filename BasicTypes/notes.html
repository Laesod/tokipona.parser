    <h2>Facilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Parse text to C# data structure.</li>
        <li>Support C# data facilities, such as Equality, Comparison, Serialization, TypeConversion, Mapping, etc</li>
        <li>Serialize C# data structure to a lossy, human readable string.</li>
        <li>Serialize to alternative formats, namely, English Gloss and Structure Annotated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>TODO</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Run-ons (e.g. poetry)-- probably via normalization (insert missing periods)</li>
        <li>Verb phrase work: modals (m m m V adv adv adv)</li>
        <li>Verb phrase work: transformatives (li phrase with pi e ...)</li>
        <li>Verb phrase work: better nominal/adjective predicate/intransitive detection.</li>
        <li>Verb phrase- kama/tawa + np </li>
        <li>Possibly treat ... (missing text) as a formal thing</li>
        <li>Better treatment of direct speech</li>
        <li>Pronouns as 1st class</li>
        <li>Better treatment of Discourse runs of linked sentences</li>
        <li>Compound word dictionary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>INPROCESS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove null tokens from ToString() results (but maybe leave in bracketed or change to 0)</li>
        <li>Deal with o o o vocative edge case.</li>
        <li>Implement class hierarchy with Token as a base for essentially all content (and maybe a separate class for particle)</li>
        <li>Implement proper modifiers</li>
        <li>Fragments (e.g. conversation)-- probably via normalization &amp; null tokens- STARTED</li>
        <li>Deal with foreign words, maybe with escaping.- STARTED</li>
        <li>Deal with direct quotes (maybe as a sort of noun).- STARTED</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>DONE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Support titles- Uses li XXX token, which can be removed before displaying. It's alike a null token.</li>
        <li>Deal with foreign words, maybe with escaping.</li>
        <li>Deal with direct quotes (maybe as a sort of noun).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>To and From Strings</h2>
    <p>The basic types can be converted to human readable format using ToString(). Be careful to not accidentally call the object.ToString() base method.</p>
    <p>The basic types can be converted from human readable format using two methods: Parse(value), TryParse(value) or using the XXXTypeConverter.</p>

    <h2>Serialization</h2>
    <p>Types support binary, XML, and JSON serialization. This differs from Parse/ToString because it isn't (very) lossy and the target consumer is a computer.</p>

    <h2>To and From Other DataType</h2>
    <p>Except for numbers, there isn't a natural way to convert among types, since they are at best similar. So for these type conversion is done with AutoMapper</p>

    <h2>Equality</h2>
    <p>All types are Classes, so are left to use their out of the box equality.</p>
    <p>Equality by value is supported with a XXXByValue class.</p>
    <p>
        Collection equality is an important concept-- collections can be the same or different base on:
        <ol>
            <li>Same but different order, e.g. strings of modifiers</li>
            <li>Exact and ordered, e.g. strings of verb phrases (temporal interpretation)</li>
            <li>Close enough (most match)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>Facts have scope. Within a scope there are bound facts, which have something that is unique to the word. That would be a noun with a proper modifier.</p>
    <p>Scopes can be linked via matching proper modifiers</p>

    <pre>
Things to support in the far future:
Titles as a concept.
Speaker tag as a concept. (e.g. jan 1: ... jan 2:... jan 1: ...)
Bullet/Labels. e.g. 1A) 1B)
Dramatic pause ... and --
Interruptions, e.g. ... inserted anywhere.
Asides (whole sentences stuffed into parens to clarify a word.)
Automatically detect entire foreign sentences.
Automatically detect likely misspellings. (all tp letters, but not a word & not proper modifer)
Automatically fix all upper cased.
Do something with this (p-phrase body has a verb + object in it):
> mi li pakala li telo e lawa sama e nena kute ~sama [kepeken e telo wawa pi tomo-tawa!]
Deal with foreign tokens with special tokens, e.g. punctuation.
