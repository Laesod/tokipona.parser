<p>Toki pona is a mostly recreational language. Several interesting applications have been suggested, some play to toki pona's strength, some which could be said of either any conlang or any language period.</p>
<h3>Why Toki Pona is an Interesting as a Therapeutic Language</h3>
<p>Let's imagine that we don't dismiss the idea immediately and assume that is plausible that learning a language could have some theraputic value for some malady. How would we test this? People bilingual from birth already are reaping the potential rewards (or harm, there really are people who think multilingualism is harmful).  Learning a langauge is such a big chore that it's unlikely to get really good compliance unless the language is really small or really similar to ones own language. The "really similar" language would be like a Norwegian learning Danish, or anyone in Europe learning Esperanto. I'm sure there is a case to be made that Esperanto be considered. Esperanto, despite it's virtues is not a small language-- it's dictionary is just as large as any natural language.  Toki pona on the other hand, even after taking into account "set phrases" is still very small in vocabulary and concept count for grammar.</p>

<h3>Alzheimer's Prevention</h3>
<p>If you already have Alzheimer's then toki pona won't help. If you are likely to go get Alzheimer's you may want to start studying any language today, since it may have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3794479.stm">a protective effect.</a></p>

<h3>Mood Disorders/Depression</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor">Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor</a> has been associated with depression. Not enough and one gets depressed. BDNF can be stimulated through mental stimulation, such as learning a language.</p>

<h3>Data Transfer Format</h3>
<p>Any language that can be written in BNF can be used as a data format. Toki pona isn't really suited to the task, but it is an interesting possibility.</p>
