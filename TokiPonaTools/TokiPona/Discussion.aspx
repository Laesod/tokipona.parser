<p><b>Wikia, Wikipedia and independent wiki's</b> The center of the toki pona community keeps moving. It started out mostly in irc and the yahoo mailing list, at one time was very active on live journal, and wikia.</p>
<p>toki pona owes a lot of it's current "fame" to the wikipedia article and the large number of languages the article was translated into, but be careful about posting anything but seriously well thought out and researched material on wikipedia.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://forums.tokipona.org">The Forum</a></b>. But there is a lot of good old content there, including a copy of the yahoo mailing list. You can subscribe to all posts on a forum, or just to response on threads you started or participated in.</p>
<p><b>Personal sites, Blogs, Blogger and Geocities</b>. People tend to show up in the blogosphere, post a few toki pona articles and disappear. To catch them, you need to detect them with <a href="http://www.socialmention.com/">a social mention search</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">a google alerts search</a>. Once you find them, subscribe to their RSS feed, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">google reader</a> is good enough.  If it doesn't have an RSS feed, use <a href="http://page2rss.com/">Page2Rss</a>, but only if you know what page you are watching. Here are some notable toki pona blogs</p>

<p><b>Facebook</b>. Face book doesn't notify me if a messages is posted to a group, doesn't have RSS. At the moment, Facebook is not a successful place for groups.</p>

<p><b>LiveJournal</b>. LiveJournal is like group blogging. It used to be very active and had active <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_tp/">Russian</a> and <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/tokipona/">general (mostly English)</a> communities. At the moment, it's entirely quiet. At one time, these people were <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/directory.bml?int_like=tokipona&opt_pagesize=100&start_search=1"> interested in toki pona</a>, and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/directory.bml?int_like=toki%20pona&opt_pagesize=100&start_search=1">these, too</a>. It's kind of uncommon to see tp text posted in personal pages either.</p>
